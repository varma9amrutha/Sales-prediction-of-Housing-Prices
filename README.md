# Sales-prediction-of-Housing-Prices
Sales prediction of Houses in United States 
The primary goal of this task is to analyse the "house-data.csv". Firstly, the dataset is cleaned to handle null values and ensure that there are no irrelevant data when fitting it into machine learning model. The 'missForest()' function imputes the missing values &  assigns values to each missing value using either the mean or mode, then models are fitted to predict the overall condition of houses. Then, factors and labels are used so that there are three different classes corresponding to the overall condition (OverallCond), which are Poor (1-3), Average (4-6) and Good. (7-10). Logistic regression and Random Forest are used to classify the house condition, and both are analysed to see which model is better suits the problem. Furthermore, multiple linear regression and random forest methods predict housing prices. Comparing these two models uses mean squared error to see which model gives us a better prediction. Similarly, the bootstrapping resampling method estimates the test error for the multiple linear regression and random forest methods. Finally, by employing a clustering analysis, the project considers if it would be a good idea to know the number of clusters between the variables OverallCond and OverallQual.
